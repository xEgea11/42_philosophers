*****************TODO Things*********************
-[Arg_checker] The checker works just by converting with ft_atoi func; we need to implement more error checking
-[Arg_checker] Maybe we need more than we have defined 
-[Init] How to initialize?
	* We need a mechanism to make all philos wait until everyone is set
-[Algorithm] structure the algorithm in taking the forks so there is no deadlock
-[Error_checking] Check errors for thread init and thread join, at least
-[Print function, data races] Since we changed the print function, so it has all the actions, there are data races, look where we need to put the mutex at
-[Waiter - Monitor] We need a threat with its routine to control every philosopher while they eat
-[Clean_table] Function to clean the table and finish the program
-[Timestamps] We need to properly set the time when philos eat, sleep and think
-[Times_must_eat] Change the hardcode that we have so philos eat indefenitely if no "times_must_eat" is declared

Makefile:
	-fsanitize=thread --> it detects data races, and print statistics to stderr

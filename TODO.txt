*****************TODO Things*********************
-[Arg_checker]		 ----		I think is OK
-[Set_table] 	Do we actually need to convert to microseconds (ie. multiply it by 1000)?
-[Init] How to initialize?	----- Looks like OK
-[Algorithm] structure the algorithm in taking the forks so there is no deadlock ---> Looks like OK
-[Starvation]	--> Apparently this manner can cause starvation --> Maybe we should force the philos to think
																	a fraction of the time
-[Error_checking] Check errors for thread init and thread join, at least
-[Print function, data races] 	Since we changed the print function, 
								so it has all the actions, there are data races, 
								look where we need to put the mutex at				--- Do we actually need it?
-[Waiter - Monitor] We need a thread with its routine 
					to control every philosopher while they eat	----	Looks like OK
-[Clean_table] Function to clean the table and finish the program	--	TODO
-[Timestamps] We need to properly set the time when philos eat, sleep and think	--	TODO
-[Times_must_eat] 	Change the hardcode that we have 
					so philos eat indefenitely if no "times_must_eat" is declared	--	TODO

------------------------------DETALLES--------------------------------------
Makefile:
	-fsanitize=thread --> it detects data races, and print statistics to stderr
